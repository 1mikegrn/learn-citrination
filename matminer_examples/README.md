# `matminer` Examples

[`matminer`](http://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/) is a Python library for data mining in the field of materials science. It was developed by a group of researchers at UC Berkeley / LBNL and the citation is [Ward et al. *Computational Materials Science*, **152** (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025618303252).

These examples show how `matminer` can interact with Citrination to process materials data. You will have to install `matminer` and [`pymatgen`](https://pymatgen.org/) separately on Python 3.6+ in order to run the notebooks in this folder.
