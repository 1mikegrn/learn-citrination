Demos and tutorials for API access to Citrination.com

## Requirements

Most of these tutorials are jupyter notebooks backed by a python3 kernel.  You'll need:
 - python3 with Jupyter.  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is highly recommended
 - `pypif` and `citrination_client` packages:
 
 ```pip install pypif citrination_client```

 - A citrination client API key: go to your account page on [citrination](https://stage.citrination.com/users/edit) and copy it into your environment
