    "In this demo, we will look at how we can take data directly out of papers use them to build predictive models on the Citrination UI. We will work with a dataset for [shape memory alloys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape-memory_alloy) (SMAs), which are materials that are able to \"remember\" their shape such that post-deformation, they will return to their pre-deformed shape when heated. They present an attractive alternative to motorized actuators for many applications."
